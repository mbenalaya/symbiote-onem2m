symbIoTe-onem2m
--------------------

SymbIoTe2oneM2M (symbIoTe oneM2M Extension for cross platform smart residence applications) project objectives are: 

- Make available a complete oneM2M-based IoT platform including both HW & SW. 
- Develop the interworking between oneM2M and symphony IoT platforms following SymbIoTe federation approach. 
- Implement a relevant use case showcasing federation with symphony IoT platform for Smart Residence pilot sites.

Setup
--------------------

The supported setups are:

- oneM2M paltform : a server which offers a full implementation of oneM2M standard. It supports the different types of interfaces and nodes defined in the standard including Infrastructure Node (IN), Middle Node (MN), Application Service Node (ASN) and Application Dedicated Node (ADN).

- oneM2M Application Dedicated Node : we provide a java application, namely simdev, which plays the role of an ADN. It allows to manage devices by respecting oneM2M standard. For each equipment, we create a resource of type AE. Each resource contains two resources of type container: sensor and actuator. The first container resource makes possible to recover data from the equipment and the second container makes possible to operate it.

- oneM2M CLD components (L1 compliance level) 

- oneM2M Rap plugin. 


Running
-------------------

### Run symbIoTe CLD components

To configure and start L1 CLD components, please fellow the steps described in the following link: 
```
https://github.com/symbiote-h2020/SymbioteCloud/wiki/SymbIoteCloud-from-docker
```

### Run oneM2M platform

-- change to onem2m-platform directory 
-- launch oneM2M platform by executing start.sh script. 
```
./start.sh 
```


### Run oneM2M simdev application 
-- change to simdevice directory 
-- launch simedevice application by executing start.sh script. 
```
./start.sh 
```

### Publish oneM2M resources on SymbIoTe Core
Resources must be registered in the Core symbiote in order to make them accessible by any IoT platform/ application. Once the resources are registered in the core symbiote, any end user can discover them and send requests either to have access to data or to activate them.

In our case, a symbIoTe resource is created by sending HTTP POST request containing resource description on RegistrationHandlerâ€™s registration endpoint (http://test2.sensinov.com:8001/resources). **http://test2.sensinov.com** corresponds to onM2M platform domain name. 

We give in the following an example of respectively sensor and actuator resources.

  }
]
```

### Run oneM2M RAP plugin

To implement oneM2M RAP plugin, we chose to work with RAP plugin starter. In fact, the idea is to use it as dependency in implementation that connects platform with SymbIoTe RAP service. Generic parts like RabbitMQ communication with RAP component is implemented in RAP Plugin Starter library. That way a developer does not have to implement complex communication.

Example of project using RAP plugin starter is in following repository 
```
https://github.com/symbiote-h2020/RapPluginExample
```

The oneM2M RAP Plugin source code is available under **RAPPluginoneM2M**

### Access oneM2M symbIoTe resoures after resources discovery. 

The steps to access to oneM2M resources after discovering them are detailed in the following link:
